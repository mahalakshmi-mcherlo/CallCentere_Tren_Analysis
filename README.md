# CallCentere_Trend_Analysis

The development of a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for a major telecom company, aimed at uncovering insights into customer behavior and call center performance. 
Utilized a combination of data visualization best practices and insights from industry podcasts and articles to design an intuitive and visually compelling dashboard.

Key accomplishments:

Aggregated and analyzed call center data to derive relevant KPIs and metrics, including
Overall customer satisfaction
Overall calls answered/abandoned
Calls by time
Average speed of answer
Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

Implemented interactive features such as slicers and filters to allow users to drill down into specific time periods and agent performance metrics.
Incorporated a performance quadrant chart to visually assess agent performance based on average handle time and calls answered.

This project demonstrated my ability to leverage data visualization tools and techniques to drive business insights and deliver value to clients in the telecom industry."
